## How-To-Run
Under repository name, click **clone or download**.

Place the program anywhere you want and run the program from terminal by executing the following command:

```
python3 Anime-Console.py
```

That should do the trick! You're all set, you filthy weeb.

## I don't like how this works
Me neither. I'm still a novice programmer so feel free to improve the code or just make up your own. I don't mind, have fun.
